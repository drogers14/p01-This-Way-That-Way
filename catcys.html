<p><h3>  You followed what your adventurous kitty heart told you to. You followed them
  all the way to Shady Creek woods, you could tell it was Shady Creek because
  like in the name, its shady.</p></h3>
  <p><h3>You were having second thoughts the flying creatures, but you also wanted
    to see what the
     commotion was all about. You advanced towards the spot that they seemed to
     be congregating at. You see some sort of bear or something, but it has wings.</h3></p>
